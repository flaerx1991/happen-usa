		<emwfullquote><![CDATA["As Executive Director of an Assisted Living Community, I highly recommend EmpowerMe Wellness as a valuable service for residents. EmpowerMe brings a variety of therapies that are designed for the senior population. They set up on-site, which allows residents to receive physical, occupational, and speech therapies right in their own homes. The quality of service is top-notch and the EmpowerMe team is highly skilled in bringing in this wonderful service with very little trouble. Set up is easy, communication is thorough and effective, and they are always seeking to improve services to ensure residents, families, and providers are completely satisfied with this service. They truly understand Senior Living Communities and what is needed to optimize care and fill in the gaps with services that can be provided with convenience and efficiency.
I highly recommend EmpowerMe Wellness to any senior living community looking to optimize the quality of care."]]></emwfullquote>

		<emwfullquote><![CDATA["It is with great respect; I highly recommend EmpowerMe Wellness as a preferred provider of services for residents. Our company entered a partnership with EmpowerMe early last year and have seen vast improvements in our resident’s quality of life and level of independence. EmpowerMe Wellness offers a variety of services that are designed with the senior population in mind. The EmpowerMe team is set up in each of our communities, this allows our resident to receive all services within their homes. EmpowerMe Wellness also ensures only the highest quality of therapists are part of their team. They become part of our communities and part of our teams, which allows our residents to trust them and want to use their services. Their teams intentionally go above and beyond to make our communities’ workflow efficient and resident care is the top priority. EmpowerMe Wellness does not just bring therapy, diagnostics, or pharmacy services to communities, they bring a sense of family and compassion. The Villas of Holly Brook strives daily to provide life changing care and with our partnership with EmpowerMe Wellness we are meeting that goal and beyond. EmpowerMe Wellness understands what it takes to meet residents where they are at and have the skill set to improve resident’s level of independence.

		<emwfullquote><![CDATA["I entered the Executive Director position at The Villas of Holly Brook in Bellevue a month ago and was intrigued by having EmpowerMe Wellness therapy in our community at all times! Since I've taken this position, I've encountered many experiences where EmpowerMe Wellness has created MAJOR improvements to enhance the quality of my residents' lives! "Our therapy director, Stephanie Rose has been phenomenal with communicating our residents' needs and always has a positive attitude working with the seniors! She even led a karaoke event, which I'm sure was a little off her 'key.' (Ha ha ha!) She's a huge asset to our community and we couldn't be more thankful for her. "Therapy is truly important to enriching seniors' lives and I've been excited to let every new resident know this information the minute they walk through the doors! Thank you, EmpowerMe Wellness. I look forward to working more with your company — not only with the therapy services you offer, but beginning lab diagnostics as well!" ]]></emwfullquote>
