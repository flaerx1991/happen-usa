As we get older, the cells of the heart muscle slowly degenerate. The heart and its valves become thicker and fill more slowly, which can cause issues with circulation and blood pressure. </p><p>‍</p><p id="""">Common signs of heart disease include chest pain; shortness of breath; pain in your neck, jaw, or shoulder; pain or numbness in arms and legs; and more. Symptoms presenting in seniors might be less pronounced than those in younger people. Individuals experiencing these, or other concerning symptoms, should contact their primary care provider. </p><p>‍</p><h3 id="""">Activities to Boost Heart Health</h3><p id="""">Maintaining a healthy heart is as simple as making consistent, healthy choices. Here are five senior-friendly activities that have a significant impact on heart health. </p><p>‍</p><ol id=""""><li><strong id="""">Stay active<br></strong>For the prevention of heart disease, it is recommended to exercise or be active for at least 30-60 minutes each day. Exercise lowers blood pressure and cholesterol, two factors that have a considerable influence on heart health. Seniors might achieve this by walking with friends or joining a community exercise class.</li></ol><p>‍</p><ol start=""2"" id=""""><li><strong id="""">Eat a plant-based diet<br></strong>Red meat contains high levels of saturated fats that can raise your low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and <a href=""https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/eating-red-meat-daily-triples-heart-disease-related-chemical"" id="""">increase the risk of heart disease</a>.

Plant-based diets are lower in calories, higher in fiber, and help you feel full more quickly.</li></ol><p>‍</p><ol start=""3"" id=""""><li><strong id="""">Eliminate tobacco<br></strong>While ending an addiction is difficult, tobacco is one of the worst things for the heart – chemicals in tobacco damage the heart and blood vessels. Smoking also reduces the amount of oxygen in the blood, putting more strain on the heart and forcing it to supply more.</li></ol><p id=""""> </p><ol start=""4"" id=""""><li><strong id="""">Manage stress<br></strong>Stress management is one of the most important things that seniors can do. When put under stress, the body has a primitive fight-or-flight response. As the body releases adrenaline, blood pressure and heart rate increase. This puts unneeded strain on the heart.</li></ol><p>‍</p><ol start=""5"" id=""""><li><strong id="""">Get regular check-ups<br></strong>Schedule an appointment with your doctor for more information on how to best prevent heart disease.

During that time, she acquired a wealth of experience, but she was eager for something new.</p><p>“I wanted to explore an unfamiliar area and try a skilled nursing facility setting,” Shari said. The opportunity to work with seniors as a career pathway had piqued her interest. Little did she know at the time that this change would transform her entire perspective on therapy services.&nbsp;</p><p>“Finding and exploring ways to provide meaningful sessions, understanding what puts the ‘wind in residents’ sails’ — it all gave me a deeper motivation to be creative with therapy services,” she says.</p><p>During the onset of COVID, senior living communities saw the need for increased health and safety regulations. Shari saw this as an opportunity to get more creative in her work.&nbsp;</p><p>“The residents we worked with would sit at a table or in their rooms just overwhelmed by their depression and loneliness,” she said. “It literally became a matter of life or death for myself and my fellow therapists to implement occupational therapy services with a fresh and creative mind. We took it upon ourselves to give each and every senior a reason to live – a reason to get up and move and live life to the fullest, despite the circumstances.”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h5><strong>Creating connections.</strong></h5><p>In senior care, you form purposeful and meaningful relationships with residents and their family members, working together to navigate the changes and challenges that come their way.&nbsp;</p><p>“I had one resident who fought everyone,” Shari said. “She was constantly hitting her hands on the table and resisting any attempts to calm her. I learned in occupational therapy school to look at the whole person — mentally, emotionally, physically, and spiritually — as well as their environmental context. So I made the effort to learn more about her.”&nbsp;<br></p><p>When the resident was first admitted to the community, her family completed a Life Story interview. “From that, I learned that she was Catholic. So I found her a rosary. A caregiver immediately sat with her and said the Lord’s Prayer. The resident started to recite the prayers with that caregiver, and it brought about a new bond between them. A peaceful demeanor came upon her, and everyone around her.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h5><strong>Serving as an advocate.</strong></h5><p>As a therapist in senior living care, you can be the voice for seniors who are unable to make their needs known.&nbsp;<br></p><p>“It has been vital for me to learn about each and every resident in the community — to learn to be open-minded and to look past a person’s outer parts and embrace their humanity,” said Shari. To better understand the needs of the residents she serves, Shari works with the community’s caregivers and staff to find out:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Which residents are experiencing the most challenges?&nbsp;</li><li>Which residents are refusing care?&nbsp;</li><li>Which residents are at risk of elopement?&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p>‍</p><h5><strong>Finding community.</strong></h5><p>From residents, to staff, to family members, to other therapists — the social circle you build as a therapy provider in senior living is different from most rehab settings.&nbsp;<br></p><p>“I have learned so many treatment approaches by working with residents and getting to know their interests and abilities,” says Shari. “But it’s almost as crucial to learn how to work with other therapists and caregivers — especially those with different personality types and skill sets. By helping your colleagues understand how their skills, talents, and abilities fit into a larger picture, you can create a better environment for your residents and for the people who work with them.”<br></p><p>Working as a therapist in a senior living setting very quickly becomes so much more than providing therapy. It offers opportunities to form personal, meaningful connections with both residents and other therapists, building bonds that are deep and lasting. A collaborative relationship between therapists and residents can do more than help you better understand the needs of the people you serve — it can inspire everyone involved to feel part of something bigger than themselves.&nbsp;<br><br></p><p><em>Want to learn more about how fulfilling and rewarding a healthcare career in senior living can be?&nbsp;Visit </em><a href=""https://www.empowerme.com/careers""><strong><em>empowerme.com/careers</em></strong></a><em> today.</em></p>",,,,,,Fri Apr 15 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Senior Living and Careers in Healthcare,"Fostering a collaborative, respectful relationship with family caregivers is at the heart of every healthcare decision we make in senior living.

However, it can also be a time of significant stress. </p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">“As we age, the physical and emotional effects caused by stress only continue to grow more pronounced, ” explains Julia Baechle, MOTR/L, CDP, an occupational therapist and Vice President of Clinical Quality and Support at EmpowerMe Wellness. “Seniors need to be very intentional about how they &nbsp;avoid, manage, and cope with stress.” </p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">In today’s post, Julia shares her expertise on why stress is particularly problematic for seniors, how to avoid it, and what to do when it creeps in.</p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">The Problem with Stress</strong></h2><p id="""">Stress is more than just uncomfortable and unenjoyable; it can also cause, prolong, or exacerbate other health problems. Left unchecked, stress can: </p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Cause declines in heart health and lung capacity</strong>, especially among sedentary seniors. This can keep them from accommodating the body’s natural stress response.<br>‍</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Compromise executive functioning</strong>, causing difficulty concentrating and even short-term memory problems.<br>‍</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Lead to difficulty sleeping</strong>, which can cause decreased strength and endurance and increased risk of falls and chronic diseases.<br>‍</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Decrease immune responses to disease.</strong> This may lead to increased illness, fatigue, and strain on the body. Respiratory illness can also result from a lack of physical activity during times of stress.<br>‍</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Contribute to poor eating habits. </strong>This is particularly important for older adults, as weight loss can have a negative impact on overall health.<br>‍</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Stress has been shown to delay wound healing.</strong></li></ul><p id="""">‍</p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">How to Avoid Stress</strong></h2><p id="""">Fortunately, stress can be avoided and minimized with a little intentionality and planning. As a bonus, the activities that help us avoid and minimize stress can be enjoyable in and of themselves. Here are four activities that help better position seniors to deal with stress:</p><ol id=""""><li id="""">Regular Exercise</li></ol><p id=""""><strong id="""">Why:</strong> During the holiday season, particularly in cold climates, it’s easy to choose warm and cozy activities over exercise. But physical activity increases endorphins, raises self-esteem, and improves mood. </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">What: </strong>Make sure you have at least 15 minutes of exercise each day. Great options for seniors include walking, yoga, chair exercises, dancing and swimming.</p><ol start=""2"" id=""""><li id="""">A Healthy Diet</li></ol><p id=""""><strong id="""">Why:</strong> We all know eating healthy can be particularly challenging during the holiday season. Eating junk food and sugar creates physical stress for our bodies that adds to our overall stress load. On the other hand, choosing foods high in nutrients improves the body’s ability to handle stress.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">What:</strong> Drink plenty of water and seek out fruits and vegetables that are packed with nutrients. Of course, it is okay to indulge in special treats, but make a plan for moderation.</p><ol start=""3"" id=""""><li id="""">Practice Gratitude</li></ol><p id=""""><strong id="""">Why:</strong> Focusing on the things that bring joy and gratitude actually make us feel happier. In the busyness of the holiday season, it is easy to focus on the to-do list and not take time to appreciate what we have. Practicing daily gratitude not only helps mentally cope with stress but also affects our bodies. For example, <a href=""https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2019/03/practicing-gratitude"" id="""">one study found</a> that gratitude was linked to fewer signs of heart disease. </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">What:</strong> Keep a gratitude journal. Each day, take time to identify three things to be thankful for.</p><ol start=""4"" id=""""><li id="""">Plan for Joy</li></ol><p id=""""><strong id="""">Why: </strong>Including enjoyable activities in your schedule helps manage stress by providing something to look forward to. Depending on the activity, you’ll also be boosting happiness-inducing hormones that help cope with stress. </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Wh</strong><strong>at</strong>: Plan to include at least one activity per day that brings you joy. <em id="""">Need some ideas?</em></p><p id="""">Call a friend or family member, play your favorite game, sit outside and watch for birds, work a puzzle, snuggle a pet, or listen to music you enjoy.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">Responding to Stress</strong></h2><p id="""">Despite our best efforts, stress can still creep in. Here are four &nbsp;activities and exercises to help deal with stress:</p><p id="""">‍</p><ol id=""""><li id="""">Deep Breaths: </li></ol><p id="""">Practice deep breathing exercises throughout the day. Move your body into a more relaxed state, focus on breathing slowly and filling your lungs fully with air before exhaling. Put a hand on your stomach or count:inhale for four seconds, hold for two seconds, and exhale for six seconds.)</p><p id="""">‍</p><ol start=""2"" id=""""><li id="""">Meditate: </li></ol><p id="""">Take time to quiet your mind and meditate. You can utilize technology for guided meditation and stress relief techniques — for example, there are a number of smartphone apps dedicated to helping people better practice mindfulness.</p><p id=""""> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p><ol start=""3"" id=""""><li id="""">Stretch</li></ol><p id="""">Stretching is a great way to alleviate muscle tension that can occur as part of the stress response. Stretching exercises produce “proprioceptive input,” which is the scientific term for sensory information that activates the joints and muscles. This kind of input not only makes our bodies more responsive to movement, but it also creates a calming effect for our minds!</p><p id="""">‍</p><ol start=""4"" id=""""><li id="""">Utilize Your Senses </li></ol><p id="""">Listen to your favorite music, get a massage, use aromatherapy diffusers or lotions, watch a movie, or enjoy a healthy treat. You can find stress relief can come from engaging any one of your five senses.</p><p id="""">‍<strong id="""">Experiencing stress but don’t know where to start? </strong>Your primary care physician &nbsp;can help identify stress coping strategies and activities that are right for you!

He had hip replacement surgery in January and spent his recovery time planning his garden so he'd be ready to plant in the spring.&nbsp;<br></p><p>With the daffodils in bloom, the sun shining, and the robins singing, Mr. Jones dusted off the wheelbarrow and grabbed his shovel!&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, after a few rocky attempts at digging and squatting, he was worried and exhausted. He had more trouble getting the wheelbarrow out of storage than he anticipated, he almost fell while tripping over the uneven walkway, and his back was aching.</p><p>Luckily, in a lightbulb moment, he remembered the therapist who helped him recover from his hip replacement surgery all those months ago. Mr. Jones knew precisely who he should call!</p><ul><li>If you think Mr. Jones should call his physical therapist, jump to option #1.</li><li>If you think Mr. Jones should call his occupational therapist, jump to option #2.</li></ul><p>‍</p><h5><strong>Option #1:</strong></h5><p><strong>‍</strong>Mr. Jones calls his physical therapist (PT) and describes the difficulties he’s having. They schedule a time to meet.</p><p>Together, Mr. Jones and his PT work to strengthen his hips and improve his range of motion. The PT teaches Mr. Jones exercises to target core strength and demonstrates how to use better body mechanics while squatting and bending, reducing the potential for injury.</p><p>They develop a home exercise program that includes stretching so Mr. Jones can warm up his muscles before working in the garden. They practice walking together on the uneven soil and through the garden rows, carefully avoiding any newly sprouted plants. The PT exercises have made Mr. Jones stronger, and his posture and confidence have improved, too.</p><p>It feels like something is missing, though. Mr. Jones is scared he might lose his balance while picking up the heavy old watering can. His knees hurt from kneeling on the hard ground, and the wheelbarrow is challenging to manage.</p><p>‍</p><h5><strong>Option #2:</strong></h5><p>Mr. Jones calls his occupational therapist (OT) and describes his difficulties. They schedule a time to meet.</p><p>The OT encourages Mr. Jones to swap out his heavy watering can for a lighter weight model, then teaches him how to lift it — with bent knees instead of lifting from the waist. Mr. Jones learns how to use a kneeling pad, and the OT wisely recommends he keep a chair close for scheduled rest breaks in the shade. Mr. Jones practices getting in and out of the chair, and the OT uses tape to mark where his hands should go when sitting down (which reminds Mr. Jones that he shouldn’t try to sit down with a rake in his hand).</p><p>Mr. Jones practices reaching to pull weeds while keeping his balance. With his OT’s advice, he decides he should use a wagon instead of a wheelbarrow, which makes him feel much safer.</p><p>Mr. Jones feels like something is missing, though. His lower back and hips are sore. He's afraid to push himself after hip surgery, and he feels weak – he wonders if what he's feeling is normal. Mr. Jones is not confident walking through the garden on uneven terrain.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><h4><strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong></h4><p>Even though Mr. Jones is happy with the progress he's making with his therapist, he's still unable to spend as much time in the garden as he would like. With the fantasy of growing a prize-winning pumpkin starting to fade, he wonders if he’s out of options. That's when he remembers that after surgery, he had two therapists helping him recover, not just one!&nbsp;</p><ul><li>If you think Mr. Jones should call the other therapist, too, jump to option #1.</li><li>If you think Mr. Jones should throw in the towel and give up his life-long dream of growing a state fair ribbon-winning, record-setting pumpkin, then you’re out of options, but no one wants that for Mr. Jones!</li></ul><p>‍</p><h5><strong>Option #1:</strong></h5><p>After working with both his physical and occupational therapists, Mr. Jones is elated! They each helped him regain his balance and restore his confidence in different ways!</p><p>PT improved his posture through stretching and adaptations to enhance his spine and hip flexibility. Through lower body strengthening, Mr. Jones improved his postural awareness and stability. He got better at maneuvering around obstacles and on uneven surfaces.&nbsp;</p><p>OT helped Mr. Jones avoid a fall with environmental modifications like the chair, wagon, and lightweight watering can. The OT also challenged his balance while multitasking and helped him realize the limitations of his endurance, which in turn helped him understand that rest breaks are a vital component to reducing fall risk.</p><p>Mr. Jones’ hard work paid off — he won a purple ribbon and broke the state fair record! He thanked both of his therapists in his acceptance speech and acknowledged that he couldn't have done it without them.</p><p>‍</p><h5><strong>The Moral of the Story:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Balance overlaps both physical and occupational therapies. Both disciplines should address balance using their unique expertise, vision, and skill. Calling in a physical therapist to help with seniors’ balance may seem more obvious at first glance, but occupational therapy's contribution to improving balance should not be overlooked.</p><p>Working together provides a more comprehensive view of performance – especially when the OT and PT each measure progress using different metrics and share their outcomes and observations.&nbsp;</p><p>In most cases, seniors need both PT and OT to achieve their balance goals and live happily ever after!<br></p>",,,,,,Fri Apr 22 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Finding Balance: a Choose-Your-Own Adventure Story,"Mr. Jones set his sights on winning the annual giant pumpkin competition at the state fair!

Of course, the key to any exercise program is finding something enjoyable! Here are six brain-boosting activities for seniors that are also a fun way to spend time: </p><p>‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Word Games</strong> </h3><p id="""">Word games, like the classic board game Scrabble or the new online sensation Wordle, have much to offer seniors. Brains get a workout thanks to the necessity of word recall and reasoning. Physical games like Scrabble have the added benefit of combining these brain skills with fine motor skills. Plus, a little competition is always fun! </p><p>‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Reading</strong></h3><p id="""">One of the most relaxing ways to exercise your brain may be enjoying a good read. From daily news articles to light-hearted beach reads, the act of processing information and comprehending sentences is a healthy challenge for the brain. </p><p>‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Playing Cards</strong></h3><p id="""">Card games like Solitaire and Rummy require memory, problem solving, and alternating attention. Plus, because new hands are dealt every time, the brains enjoy a new challenge every few minutes. Playing cards has the added bonus of being a great social activity, which brings with it additional mental exercise from engaging and conversing with friends.</p><p>‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Puzzles</strong></h3><p id="""">Brains love puzzles! When putting a jigsaw puzzle together, the brain strengthens a variety of abilities including spatial orientation, organizing/sorting, and visual memory. </p><p>‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Journaling</strong></h3><p id="""">Writing in a daily journal is a helpful practice to declutter the brain in order to maximize attention, as well as facilitate information processing and reflect/improve mindfulness. </p><p>‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Pairing Physical &amp; Mental Activities</strong></h3><p id="""">The brain loves to work together with the body! One great way to do so is to pair mental tasks related to sequencing with simple physical activities. For example, counting or reciting the alphabet while taking a quiet walk benefits focused attention and the ability to sequence information. Once a combination is mastered, challenge the brain further by changing the pattern, such as counting while alternating with reciting letters of the alphabet.</p><p>‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">How Activities Boost Memory</strong></h3><p id="""">Memory is not something we simply have or don’t have. “Memory is a process,” explains Emily Eckhardt, MA, CCC-SLP, CDP, with EmpowerMe Wellness’ Clinical Programming and Education department. “To build and maintain memory, our brains need to exercise all the steps connected to that process.” Memory requires the ability to focus, process, interpret, organize, consolidate, and recall information. If any of the steps in this process are impaired, memory may become impaired. </p><p>‍</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">A key aspect of boosting brain health and memory is the ability to focus and maximize attention. </strong>To be fully attentive requires one to organize, relax, and concentrate – which is often easier said than done! The ability to be fully attentive and focused strengthens the brain and its capacity for memory. On that same note, distraction negatively impacts memory. Brain health and memory are served well by avoiding things or activities that are cluttered, busy, stressful, or bring anxiety.</p><p>‍</p><p>‍<em id="""">Through its “The Focused Mind” program, EmpowerMe Wellness team members help senior living residents maintain cognitive ability.

A well-rounded approach can impact mental, social, and emotional wellbeing. This is even more important for the senior population considering the close association with <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5407450/"" target=""_blank"">chronic pain and depression</a>,as well as <a href=""https://www.alz.org/help-support/caregiving/stages-behaviors/depression#:~:text=Experts%20estimate%20that%20up%20to,Apathy"" target=""_blank"">dementia and depression</a>.

Having therapy services on-site at senior living communities helps seniors live healthier and happier lives while gaining or maintaining their independence.</p><p><br></p><p>Rather than assigning very specific physical goals for a resident, on-site therapists engage in conversations with the resident to help them find an activity they want to accomplish and has meaning for them.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Goals often look like:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Attending the event of a grandchild</li><li>Talking with a family member on the phone more often</li><li>Maintaining their ability to pay their bills</li><li>Engaging in a new wellness activity in the community (yoga, walking club, movie night, etc.)</li><li>Being able to walk their dog on their own.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Whatever activity they choose, the ownership of setting their own goal is cognitively and emotionally rewarding.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>One study found that a resident’s ability to play a role in choosing their own activities in their community (as well as what they can do in the day throughout the facility) was associated with fewer depressive <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17272732/"" target=""_blank"">symptoms</a>.</p><p>‍</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center"" style=""padding-bottom:33.75%"" data-rt-type=""video"" data-rt-align=""center"" data-rt-max-width="""" data-rt-max-height=""33.75%"" data-rt-dimensions=""640:360"" data-page-url=""https://vimeo.com/656710180""><div><iframe allowfullscreen=""true"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/656710180"" title=""Oaks Senior Living | Testimonial Ad""></iframe></div></figure><p>‍</p><p>Beyond the reward of accomplishing their goal, this approach also establishes more trust and a personal connection between the therapist and resident. It becomes more than just a “to-do” list from the therapist. It helps seniors feel that they are a part of their community - a home-like environment that is there to support them.

Simply put, while a specialist like a cardiologist or pulmonologist has specialized training and education related to a specific area of expertise, a PCP is knowledgeable about the whole body and mind. </p><p>‍</p><p id="""">PCPs are the “gatekeepers” to maintaining one’s health and preventing further complications. One of the biggest benefits of primary care is that it has the potential to lower the total cost of one’s healthcare. Most insurance plans, including <a href=""https://www.aarp.org/health/medicare-qa-tool/does-medicare-cover-physical-exams/#:~:text=En%20espa%C3%B1ol%20%7C%20Medicare%20does%20not,keep%20track%20of%20your%20health."" id="""">Medicare</a>, include yearly wellness check-ups at no cost to the patient. Annual visits to a PCP mean that warning signs can be caught earlier, saving one the time and cost of treating a condition that has gotten out of hand.</p><p>‍</p><h3 id="""">What to Look for in a Primary Care Provider</h3><p>‍</p><p id="""">There are many criteria to consider when choosing a primary care provider. How is their “bedside manner”? Would it be best if the provider spoke languages other than English? How important is travel distance? Choosing a PCP can quickly feel overwhelming. Here are a few tips to help determine the right provider:</p><p>‍</p><ol id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Find an accessible medical office</strong></li></ol><p>Even if you only visit the office once a year, it is important to be able to reliably access your provider’s office. Seniors in particular should consider transportation options to and from appointments. Research possible shuttles to the office or see if the medical providers make house calls.</p><p>‍</p><ol start=""2"" id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Assess the medical office’s customer service</strong></li></ol><p>Is the staff who answers the phone friendly? Do they answer questions in a timely and respectful manner? If not, it might be better to find another office.</p><p id=""""> &nbsp;</p><ol start=""3"" id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Gather recommendations from family, friends, or neighbors</strong></li></ol><p>Referrals from others are a great way to find a new medical provider! The knowledge that close friends and family trust the PCP can put one’s mind at ease.</p><p>‍</p><ol start=""4"" id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Research PCPs that are well-versed in senior care</strong></li></ol><p>There are different types of PCPs, such as providers in a family practice, internal medicine, or general practice. All should have a robust knowledge of how to care for the aging body. However, some might be more familiar with senior care than others – do a little research and find out! </p><p>‍</p><ol start=""5"" id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Find a PCP with the right personality</strong></li></ol><p>It’s important to find a trustworthy provider. If an appointment doesn’t feel right, don’t hesitate to try again with someone different! Branching out and trying new providers until the right one is found is essential. Each provider has their own distinct bedside manner, and each patient has preferences for how medical information is communicated. It is worth the extra legwork to find a PCP whose personality aligns with the patient. </p><p>‍</p><p>Primary care is vital for people in ALL stages of life, which is why EmpowerMe Wellness offers Primary Care in many senior communities across the country.

Because many therapy companies place an overriding priority on therapist productivity, the amount of time a therapist spends with each senior is often limited. Plus, many companies require therapists to travel to multiple sites in a day, giving them little opportunity to build meaningful insights on how best to motivate the seniors they work with.<br></p><p>‍</p><p>By comparison, a full-time on-site therapy program is much better suited to delivering a goal-oriented therapy curriculum. This type of program places therapists in a single senior living community each day, all day, allowing them to develop deeper relationships with residents and their families, gain important information from the community’s care team members, and provide a broader spectrum of wellness programs and classes.&nbsp;<br></p><p>‍</p><p>This close one-on-one interaction enables full-time on-site therapists to better understand what each resident values most, which is key to helping them develop goals that motivate them to succeed.<br></p><p>‍</p><p>“Some communities don’t see the need for on-site therapy simply because they have never had it before,” explains Lisa Meyer, MBA, a physical therapist and EmpowerMe’s Senior Vice President of Operations.<strong> </strong>”But because our therapists are on-site every day, they become part of the residents’ care team. That gives them the ability to identify not just a resident’s physical needs, but their emotional needs as well. That’s a core component of a goal-based approach to therapy.”<br></p><p>‍</p><p>Beyond the benefit to the patient,<strong> this personal approach to rehab therapy is far more rewarding for the therapists</strong>, which can be a key component in attracting and retaining top-tier clinicians. As therapy team members learn more about the seniors they work with, they build deep, lasting relationships. The residents’ goals become the therapists’ goals, and together they find joy and support as they progress day-by-day, celebrating their big and small wins along the way!<br></p><p>‍</p><p><strong>“Helping a resident feel a sense of hope when they achieve their goals is my greatest joy as a therapist,” </strong>said Lisa. “It’s our goal to make life as vibrant, enjoyable, and healthy as possible for every senior we serve.”<strong>&nbsp;</strong>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>Watch the video below to hear from an EmpowerMe Wellness therapist on how they have seen the goal-oriented approach make a difference for seniors, or <a href=""https://empowerme.com"">click here</a> to learn more about the EmpowerMe difference!</p><p>‍<br></p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center"" style=""padding-bottom:33.75%"" data-rt-type=""video"" data-rt-align=""center"" data-rt-max-width="""" data-rt-max-height=""33.75%"" data-rt-dimensions=""640:360"" data-page-url=""https://vimeo.com/572282682""><div><iframe allowfullscreen=""true"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/572282682"" title=""EmpowerMe | Occupational Therapy""></iframe></div></figure>",,,,,,Tue May 10 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Goal-Oriented: The Benefits of Full-Time On-Site Therapy,"For seniors, losing their ability to participate in activities they enjoy can be devastating, both mentally and emotionally.

With heightened resident expectations in mind, here are four components necessary for effective, competitive marketing in the senior living landscape.</p><p><br></p><h5>1-Understand and Exceed Market Expectations</h5><p>Every effort in your community, whether operational or marketing-focused, should take the competitive landscape into account. Have you researched your closest competitors’ services and program efficacies? Have you experienced their culture and read reviews of why people love them or leave their community? Are your strengths as an organization showcased both online and in-person to adequately stand up to the competition from the viewpoint of your target resident and their loved ones?</p><p><br></p><p>Most importantly, do your programs effectively answer the greatest area of need for residents in your market? Program efficacy and creating an environment for healthier, happier seniors is the center of effective marketing. Programs that WORK for seniors and answer their needs gain referrals and help market themselves.</p><p><br></p><h5>2-Differentiate</h5><p>What do you offer that other communities don’t? How do you differentiate your care? Does your programming and quality of care outshine your competitors? Do your therapy programs create better outcomes and drive occupancy? Be sure to highlight the strengths and offerings of your community and leverage those differences to your advantage.</p><p><br></p><h5>3- Track and Share Results</h5><p>Tracking and using data about your community’s measurable outcomes and results showcases the health and efficacy of your programs and is encouraging information for potential residents and their loved ones. For our EmpowerMe partners, we create custom reports for each community we serve that track and measure participation rates, number of visits, therapy hours worked, cancellation rates, progress notes, and data around the impact our services have had on the community’s occupancy. Residents and their families have found these numbers to be assuring evidence - that their loved ones will truly be taken care of, will have their goals acknowledged, and will be able to maintain as much independence as possible while living in place.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h5>4-Use Story and Testimonials to Create Trust and Showcase Culture</h5><p>Whether a community will feel like home is one of the greatest considerations for seniors and their families as their loved ones enter a greater level of care. Showcasing testimonials from your community can demonstrate your individualized, personal, and heartfelt approach toward residents.&nbsp;</p><p>Testimonials speak to the qualitative results of your programs that you can’t share with data, and they showcase the lifestyle that seniors can expect to live if they join your community. Potential residents can connect to your approach to care in an empathetic, personal way when they hear stories from current or recent residents. Happy residents can be your greatest referral source!</p><p><br>Interested in partnering with EmpowerMe to grow your community?

Physicians will often recommend physical therapy, or even a short-term stay in a rehabilitation center, to help build back any lost strength and range of motion. </p><p id="""">‍</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">After a Fall or Stroke</strong></h4><p id="""">Regardless of if the fall resulted in a visit to a doctor, a fall can be disorienting, not to mention painful! A fall is a useful signal to seek out physical therapy. Providers will work on building strength to help promote healing and, just as importantly, help avoid future falls. Plus, physical therapy can restore lost confidence.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">After a Diagnosis</strong></h4><p id="""">Many diagnoses have implications for balance whether caused by the issue itself or the medications prescribed to treat it. From Parkinson’s to Multiple Sclerosis to Alzheimer’s, there’s no need to wait for noticeable physical changes. The sooner and more consistently physical therapy can be integrated, the better.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">After a New Prescription Causes Balance-Related Side Effects</strong></h4><p id="""">Whenever a new medication is prescribed, talk through the potential side effects with the prescribing physician.

The therapist can then request a referral from your physician based on their findings.</p><h2 id="""">How to Find a Physical Therapy Provider</h2><p id="""">So you’ve decided it’s time for physical therapy.

In a 2021 study, researchers found that when adults ages 70-90 reported more frequent, pleasant social interactions, their cognitive performance improved for up to three days after the interaction<a href=""https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/09/210909124349.htm"">2</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Correspondingly, socialization at mealtime is a daily opportunity to provide proven cognitive improvement for seniors.</p><p><br></p><p>To make socializing and conversing easier in a senior living environment, ensure that residents with impaired hearing or vision have hearing devices or glasses on. Also, consider seating residents with similar assistance needs near each other. This encourages empathy among communication abilities at the table and lessens the embarrassment residents may feel for needing assistance.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Caretakers can even participate at the table to stimulate conversation. It can be helpful to remind residents to engage or to help start the discussion, as cognitive deficiencies may make this difficult.</p><p><br></p><p>Adjusting the Physical Environment to Facilitate Eating</p><p>As helpful adaptations, consider using plates and tablecloths with more contrast to aid residents with impaired vision. Multiple studies have shown that using white tablecloths with red plates works well. Offer cups with lids to promote safe consumption of hot liquids, and adaptive utensils to maximize independence. Consider using plates that don’t slide across the table too easily or have an additional lip or divider to prevent spills.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Although music sets a nice tone in the dining room, keep music levels low enough that hearing-impaired residents don’t have to struggle to engage in conversation. Catering the music style and lowering the volume can also help minimize distraction. If TVs are in the room, avoid turning them on at mealtime to limit distractions and encourage conversation.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Dining chair design and selection can go a long way to encourage proper posture and maximize safety and alertness for memory care patients who have trouble swallowing.</p><p><br></p><p>Although eating adjustments and adaptations are necessary for residents experiencing dementia, maximize as much as possible to create the dining experience to feel like eating at home. Simple changes like not using disposable plates and improving food quality and presentation can make eating more enjoyable and encourage consumption.</p><p><br><br></p><p>Ensuring Personalized Levels of Assistance</p><p>Finally, as residents experiencing dementia likely need some level of assistance, caretakers should attune to residents’ individual levels of need rather than assuming their level of care. Knowing their individual needs maximizes independence and confidence while making eating more enjoyable.</p><p><br></p><p>Individual attention to their level of need might look like staying updated on the resident’s personal food preferences in order to maximize nutrient intake or understand their particular area of difficulty (chewing, remembering to eat, handling utensils, etc.).&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Some residents may only need a reminder to pick up their utensils or to focus on eating, while others may deal with swallowing concerns and need full physical assistance. Remaining attuned to individual needs ensures seniors can experience the maximum amount of independence while getting the necessary nutrient intake.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>With the right adjustments to the dining environment and level of care, you can help seniors experience their highest practical level of well-being in a way that honors their independence.</p><p><br>To see the impact of a personalized approach to memory care, hear the story of an EmpowerMe resident below, or <a href=""https://vimeo.com/expfresh/review/654681280/089ab37cf4"">click here &nbsp;</a>to find an EmpowerMe community near you.</p><p>‍</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center"" style=""padding-bottom:33.75%"" data-rt-type=""video"" data-rt-align=""center"" data-rt-max-width="""" data-rt-max-height=""33.75%"" data-rt-dimensions=""640:360"" data-page-url=""https://vimeo.com/654681280""><div><iframe allowfullscreen=""true"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/654681280"" title=""Creekside | Testimonial""></iframe></div></figure>","<ol><li><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7146553/"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6779159/#:~:text=2%20Body%20Weight%20Loss%20in%20Dementia&amp;text=For%20example%2C%20data%20indicate%20that,reduced%20food%20intake%20%5B11%5D.</a><a href=""https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/09/210909124349.htm"">‍</a></li><li><a href=""https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/09/210909124349.htm"">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/09/210909124349.htm</a></li></ol>",,,,,Fri Mar 25 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Dining Tips For Seniors With Dementia,Small changes in your senior living dining area and level of care can help seniors with dementia experience their highest level of well-being.

In addition to enjoying family traditions and time together, these holiday visits are a great time to check in on the health, wellbeing and safety of aging loved ones still living at home. Use the list below as a guide during your holiday visits to consider what additional support may be in your loved one’s best interest to keep them happy, healthy, and independent.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">As you make note of any changes and needs, pay attention to your own wellbeing as well. “The holidays can prompt a litany of emotions in caregivers and family members,” explains Lauren Petry, Nurse Practitioner. “Remember, there is no right way to feel, and all of your feelings are valid."" </p><p id="""">‍</p><h1 id="""">What to Watch For:</h1><h3 id="""">Unintended Weight Changes</h3><p id="""">Gaining or losing weight can be a sign of a serious issue, such as depression, dementia, or cancer. It might also be caused by an unhealthy diet. Your loved one may lack the energy to cook nutritious and well-balanced meals. Medical conditions like arthritis or vision loss can limit an older adult’s ability to grocery shop and prepare meals. This can lead to poor nutrition and even malnutrition.</p><h3 id="""">Unsteady Walk</h3><p id="""">Falls are a leading cause of injury among older adults, but most falls are preventable. Everything from poor nutrition to medication side effects can make an older adult unsteady on their feet. During your visit, pay close attention to how well your loved one moves, both through the house and when you are out and about in the community. In addition to their gait, consider the following:</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Do they appear to intentionally avoid going up or down even a few stairs? </li><li id="""">Do they seem to be more sedentary than usual? </li><li id="""">Are there bumps and bruises on their arms and legs?</li><li id="""">Do they stumble and hold on to furniture for balance? </li><li id="""">Do they verbalize feeling dizzy when standing up from a chair? </li><li id="""">If their medical provider has recommended using a cane or walker, is their chosen assistive device compliant with industry standards? </li></ul><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id="""">Change in Lifestyle</h3><p id="""">Ask your loved one how their friends are doing, especially those you personally know. Inquire about hobbies and volunteer work they’ve been involved with and which bring them joy. Does it seem as if they’ve dropped out of favorite activities or lost contact with friends? Isolated seniors are at much higher risk for health conditions, ranging from depression to heart disease and diabetes. Seek to find out why they’ve changed long-standing habits.</p><h3 id="""">Personal Hygiene</h3><p id="""">Noting changes in your loved one’s personal hygiene can help give a medical provider a fuller picture of their overall wellbeing. Was your dad always known for his cologne and has stopped wearing it? Was your mother known to do her hair and makeup daily and has since stopped? Have you noticed your loved one wears the same outfit four days in a row? If your loved one refuses to shower or is opting for comfy, mismatched clothing, don’t force them to do otherwise for now. Make note of changes in their independence and ability to care for themselves. Meanwhile, don’t embarrass or shame them for making fashion choices that make them comfortable.</p><h3 id="""">Condition of the Home </h3><p id="""">Maintaining a home is a lot of work at any age. For seniors, it can grow increasingly difficult. Early signs that something is amiss includes piles of unopened mail on the counter, clutter, overflowing trash cans, dirty dishes, expired food in the refrigerator, dying plants, and broken appliances not being repaired. Another sign of trouble is burned cookware, which might indicate that your loved one is forgetting they have something cooking on the stove—a dangerous fire hazard. Keep in mind, it is not the aesthetic of the home that is of concern, but their safety and noticing significant changes.</p><h3 id="""">Medication Compliance</h3><p id="""">If your loved one is taking prescription medication, it can become increasingly difficult for them to manage this process. Are there prescription bottles that are empty and have not been refilled or are prescription bottles full that shouldn’t be? These are signs that your loved one may be struggling with properly managing their medication. If you notice that they are not taking their medication as prescribed, it’s something you will want to discuss.</p><h2 id="""">You Noticed Changes. Now What?</h2><p id="""">If you notice any of these signs during your next visit, it may be time to consider what options and resources are available to support your loved one. It may also be helpful to bring up these concerns with your loved one’s physician or primary care provider. And if they reside in a senior living community served by EmpowerMe Wellness, our team is always available to help you consider how to proceed. </p><p id="""">‍<strong id="""">Choose your time to discuss these issues wisely, especially at this time of the year.</strong> While extremely important, these conversations can be difficult to initiate and navigate with your loved one, and emotions can run high for people of all ages during the holiday season. Unless you feel the situation is urgent and time sensitive, plan to initiate the conversation when there is time and space for you and your loved one to really hear each other. That way, you can move forward with patience and grace for all involved.</p><p id="""">‍</p>",,,,,,Fri Jan 20 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),6 Things to Watch For During Holiday Visits with Aging Loved Ones,"‘Tis the season for spending time with loved ones!

Because many therapy companies place an overriding priority on therapist productivity, the amount of time a therapist spends with each senior is often limited. Plus, many companies require therapists to travel to multiple sites in a day, giving them little opportunity to build meaningful insights on how best to motivate the seniors they work with.<br></p><p>‍</p><p>By comparison, a full-time on-site therapy program is much better suited to delivering a goal-oriented therapy curriculum. This type of program places therapists in a single senior living community each day, all day, allowing them to develop deeper relationships with residents and their families, gain important information from the community’s care team members, and provide a broader spectrum of wellness programs and classes.&nbsp;<br></p><p>‍</p><p>This close one-on-one interaction enables full-time on-site therapists to better understand what each resident values most, which is key to helping them develop goals that motivate them to succeed.<br></p><p>‍</p><p>“Some communities don’t see the need for on-site therapy simply because they have never had it before,” explains Lisa Meyer, MBA, a physical therapist and EmpowerMe’s Senior Vice President of Operations.<strong> </strong>”But because our therapists are on-site every day, they become part of the residents’ care team. That gives them the ability to identify not just a resident’s physical needs, but their emotional needs as well. That’s a core component of a goal-based approach to therapy.”<br></p><p>‍</p><p>Beyond the benefit to the patient,<strong> this personal approach to rehab therapy is far more rewarding for the therapists</strong>, which can be a key component in attracting and retaining top-tier clinicians. As therapy team members learn more about the seniors they work with, they build deep, lasting relationships. The residents’ goals become the therapists’ goals, and together they find joy and support as they progress day-by-day, celebrating their big and small wins along the way!<br></p><p>‍</p><p><strong>“Helping a resident feel a sense of hope when they achieve their goals is my greatest joy as a therapist,” </strong>said Lisa. “It’s our goal to make life as vibrant, enjoyable, and healthy as possible for every senior we serve.”<strong>&nbsp;</strong>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>Watch the video below to hear from an EmpowerMe Wellness therapist on how they have seen the goal-oriented approach make a difference for seniors, or <a href=""https://empowerme.com"">click here</a> to learn more about the EmpowerMe difference!</p><p>‍</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center"" style=""padding-bottom:33.75%"" data-rt-type=""video"" data-rt-align=""center"" data-rt-max-width="""" data-rt-max-height=""33.75%"" data-rt-dimensions=""640:360"" data-page-url=""https://vimeo.com/572282682""><div><iframe allowfullscreen=""true"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/572282682"" title=""EmpowerMe | Occupational Therapy""></iframe></div></figure><p>‍</p><p><br></p><p>‍</p>",,,,,,Tue May 10 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Goal-Oriented: The Benefits of Full-Time On-Site Therapy,"For seniors, losing their ability to participate in activities they enjoy can be devastating, both mentally and emotionally.

After all, who hasn’t misplaced their keys from time to time or forgotten someone’s name? But those minor lapses in memory differ from dementia. Bigger lapses, such as forgetting how to manage finances and medication, are more concerning. It is important to recognize these warning signs in a loved one early so they can make the lifestyle changes that will allow them to maintain their quality of life.</p><p>‍</p><p id="""">“When presented with early warning signs, it’s more important than ever to make brain exercises — like problem solving, focused attention, and information-processing tasks — part of your daily routine,” explains Emily Eckhardt, MA, CCC-SLP, CDP, a member of EmpowerMe Wellness’ Clinical Education and Enrichment team. “It is also never too early to begin creating external aids, like written or recorded reminders, for important information to help manage your own or a loved one’s care.” </p><h3 id="""">What Are Dementia and Alzheimer’s Disease, and How Do They Differ?</h3><p>‍</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Dementia describes a group of symptoms that affect memory, thinking, and social abilities severely enough to interfere with daily life. </strong>Dementia is not a single disease, but an umbrella term that encompasses various medical conditions caused by abnormal brain changes. These changes are attributed to a decline in cognitive abilities, behavior, emotional status, and functional abilities.</p><p>‍</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia.</strong> Although not all causes of Alzheimer's are known, experts know that a small percentage are related to mutations of three genes, which can be passed down from parent to child. <a href=""https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-disease-genetics-fact-sheet#:~:text=APOE%20%CE%B54%20increases%20risk%20for,3%20percent%20carry%20two%20copies."" id="""">While several different genes are probably involved in Alzheimer's disease, one important gene that increases risk is apolipoprotein E4 (APOE)</a>. Patients with Alzheimer’s disease have plaques and tangles in their brains. Plaques are clumps of a protein called beta-amyloid, and tangles are fibrous tangles made up of tau protein. It is thought that these clumps damage healthy neurons and the fibers connecting them, causing cognitive changes.</p><p>‍</p><h3 id="""">Stages of Cognitive Change Observed in Dementia</h3><p>‍</p><p id="""">Knowing the different stages of cognitive change can be helpful when trying to best understand how to support a loved one. Our Clinical Education and Enrichment Department’s own Emily Eckhardt offers some insight into how to best support in the five different stages: </p><p>‍</p><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Mild Cognitive Impairment</em></strong></p><p id="""">A person with mild cognitive impairment will typically be able to follow directions and recall most of their important routine information to function day to day. They may deny any help at this stage; occasional cognitive assistance through reminders and support of more complex new tasks can be offered.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Early-stage Cognitive Decline</em></strong></p><p id="""">A person with early-stage cognitive decline will benefit from more structure in their day-to-day life. They can typically attend to a task for at least 20 minutes with one or two verbal or visual cues. No matter the task, try not to rush them, as they may need additional time to perform an activity. </p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Mid-stage Cognitive Decline</em></strong></p><p id="""">A person with mid-stage cognitive decline will benefit from someone else choosing the activity or setting up the task. They can typically attend to an activity for 5-20 minutes and will require consistent cues to continue. Again, do not rush to complete the activity and, at this level, do not correct errors. They will require and can follow cues or instructions. They will require direct supervision and may need to have an activity demonstrated by someone else before understanding how to perform. It is helpful to simplify the number of steps and provide verbal, visual, and hands-on cues. They may not clearly understand or hold onto a specific topic being discussed, but can be brought back to socializing with use of old photos or personal belongings.</p><p id=""""><br></p><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Late-stage Cognitive Decline </em></strong></p><p id="""">A person with late-stage cognitive decline will benefit from someone else providing constant one-on-one cueing with sensory stimulation around a single theme using familiar items. They may walk away from an activity and will need to be redirected. The person will need more time to complete a task and will work much slower than usual. They may enjoy music, singing familiar songs, and keeping rhythm by dancing and playing instruments using hand-over-hand assistance. Conversations may consist of short, simple 1-to-2-word phrases. </p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">End-stage Cognitive Decline</em></strong></p><p id="""">A person with end-stage cognitive decline may likely be provided with additional assistance from palliative care and will benefit from brief one-on-one visits with high sensory input, including music, touch, and strong sensations incorporated like taste or smell.
